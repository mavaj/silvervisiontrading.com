== Installation ==

Installation is simple. Just unzip into your plugins folder and activate the plugin. From there, you may call the function
`ronalfy_list_categories_and_posts`.  This function call will be from within a WordPress page template.

An example page template called "sitemap.php" is included in the zip file.  You can copy this file into your themes directory and use it as a page template for your sitemap if you wish.

<h3>Usage</h3>
The function by itself will return the categories and posts. It will accept most of the same arguments as `wp_list_categories`, but not all of them.
