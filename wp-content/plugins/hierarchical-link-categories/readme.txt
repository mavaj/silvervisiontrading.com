Convert WordPress' link categories to be hierarchical with this simple plugin.

== Description ==

> For support or feedback, go to the <strong><a href="http://www.seodenver.com/hierarchical-link-categories-wordpress/">official Hierarchical Link Categories plugin page</a></strong>

####This plugin requires WordPress 3.1

###Finally, Choose Parent Categories for Link Categories

One of the problems with WordPress' built-in blogroll/bookmark functionality is that you can't choose to create nested categories (sub-categories) for the links. This is silly, and makes the functionality nearly useless.

####Treat yourself to some nested blogroll categories

This plugin allows link categories to have parent categories (makes link categories "hierarchical"), saving you time and maybe even *saving the world*.
